# weather-app

## Intro

I had to create a weather app, using the asynchronous function with JS and API.

### Instructions

-   In the home page the user can enter the city of their choice.
-   On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days.
-   Show a photo of the city they entered in the form with https://unsplash.com/.
-   Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js.
-   Remember the user choice on subsequent visits.

    ## Technologies

    -   HTML
    -   SASS
    -   JAVASCRIPT
